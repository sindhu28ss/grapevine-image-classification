## Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying different grapevine leaf species using deep learning, contributing to the viticulture and food industries. 
Grapevines are primarily cultivated for their fruit, but their leaves are also valuable as a by-product, influencing both price and taste. 
Accurate classification of grapevine leaf species is essential for quality control, market pricing, and culinary applications. 
Leveraging the CNN model, this model effectively identifies five grapevine leaf species using high-resolution images. 
The model is trained with TensorFlow and Keras, deployed via Flask, and containerized with Docker and Kubernetes, ensuring scalability and ease of deployment.

## The Problem
Accurate classification of grapevine leaf species is essential for viticulture, agriculture and commercial processing. However, manual identification is time-consuming and prone to errors due to:

- ðŸ”¹ Visual Similarities: Many grapevine species have similar leaf structures, making differentiation difficult.
- ðŸ”¹ Image Variability: Changes in lighting, angles, and leaf conditions affect classification accuracy.
- ðŸ”¹ Lack of Expertise: Farmers and processors often lack technical knowledge, leading to misidentification and pricing inconsistencies.

An automated deep learning-based solution can streamline this process, improving accuracy, efficiency, and decision-making in viticulture.

## Solution: Project Objective
This project develops a deep learning model for automated classification of five grapevine leaf species using CNN architecture.

- ðŸ”¹ High Accuracy: Fine-tuned deep learning model for precise species classification.
- ðŸ”¹ Scalability: Adaptable to include additional grapevine species in the future.
- ðŸ”¹ Real-time Classification: Users can upload an image and get instant predictions with confidence scores.

## Impact & Applications
- âœ” Viticulture & Agriculture: Helps farmers identify species for optimized cultivation and disease management.
- âœ” Supply Chain & Pricing: Ensures accurate species-based pricing for commercial processing.
- âœ” Research & Conservation: Supports genetic studies and biodiversity preservation.
- âœ” Quality Control Automation: Enhances efficiency in large-scale sorting and classification.

## Dataset

- **Source:** The dataset used for this project is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkokludataset/grapevine-leaves-image-dataset/data).
- The dataset consists of images of grapevine leaves belonging to five distinct species:
    - **'Ak'**
    - **'Ala_Idris'**
    - **'Buzgulu'**
    - **'Dimnit'**
    - **'Nazli'**
- The images are high-resolution and categorized into respective species folders.
- Used for image classification to differentiate between grapevine species based on leaf characteristics.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

As part of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, several preprocessing steps were performed to ensure high-quality and clean data before model training.

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- âœ… **Removed Corrupted Images**: Identified and deleted unreadable images.
- âœ… **Removed Duplicate Images**: Used hashing to detect and remove duplicate images.
- âœ… **Checked for Blank Images**: Ensured no entirely blank images were present in the dataset.
- âœ… **Removed Blurry Images**: Used the Laplacian variance method to filter out low-quality images.
- âœ… **Analyzed Image Properties**: Examined image dimensions, file formats, and color modes.
- âœ… **Converted RGBA to RGB**: Standardized all images to RGB format for consistency.
- âœ… **Saved Cleaned Dataset in a Separate Folder**: Stored the processed dataset in `Converted_Dataset` to keep the original data intact.
